To explore and run the project correctly, you must first open the models/ folder, then consult the data/ folder which contains the files necessary for its operation. 
Next, it is recommended to move to the services/ folder, before opening the interface/ folder to check the interaction modules. Once this is done, the Tests/ folder can be consulted
to validate that everything is working correctly, and finally, the main.py file should be run to execute the complete project.
